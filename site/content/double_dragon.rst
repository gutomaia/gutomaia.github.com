:sumary: Double Dragon's good memories


Not in the mood of coding today, so let's play a classic: Double Dragon. It's hard to explain now-a-days, what a fenomenal it was back them. Therefore, before reviewing the NES version, witch i'm going to play, let's what that name stand for.

At the end eighties, every arcade had a Double Dragon machine at it's center. It opened up the genre `beat\'em up <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_'em_up>`_. Before the nineties, the arcades will be filled with games like Golden Axe, and after Final Fight, in some years, CAPCOM would lead the genre to another level. But even in the mid-nineties, Billy and Jimmy Lee's game, never loose their spot.

The game had lines, you had to wait before your coin drops in. While you're waiting, the main subject  how to control the elbom smash or how to throw an enemy from a bridge without falling too. I remeber that once I had to wait a guy cleanup the coin safe, 'cause coins were getting jammed. It was the main subject among gamers and game magazines.

This story was quite simple. Two brothers had a girl that was kidnapped by a street gang. Yep, both have a girl and --spoiler alert-- they fight each other for her at the end. Not a original story, but a great story telling with a twist ending for the time. Prior the first stage, a small intro shows henchman's puching and taking the girl away, then the garage door open's up and the music and beat begins. Eighties in this best
form with a `Streets of Fire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Fire>`_ style. I swear, I always saw
Willem Dafoe as the kidnapper. The movie scene of him taking the girl over the shoulders was printed in my mind 'cause of Double Dragon.


The HOME version
================

Playing Double Dragon, at home, without "insert coin" just "press start", was amazing. To be true, I used to have the Master System version as a child. But the Master System missed the thrill. It was even a better version than the NES. But the NES not only hit the timing, it also have two things the Master System did not, sequences (I know it's related to licensing, but I as a gamer, I don't care).

You and a friend, could spent a day defeating one and swithing for the next. `Double Dragon 2 - The Revenge` own me even before you put the cartridge on the NES. The cover is amazing. Have something from `Big Trouble in Little China` and, again, `Streets of Fire`. Graphics were simple and the arm over the body style was remarkeble.


Then you stomp on the `Double Dragon 3: The Sacred Stones`. More characters, "Once you defeated your bitter enemies join your quest". Meaning, you beat a boss you can playwith him too. And for sure, one of the hardests titles on the NES. It is hard as hell! Dammed stones, why so sacred?

I think that the NES version is the definitive console version.


A King still a King
===================

Final Fight was reigning the arcades in the early nineties and them the Super Nintendo was announced with it listed as a lauch title. At the time I though, "here comes a new.." Double Dragon. Sega's had an upstart advantange, not only `Golden Axe` was Genesis's launch title, but also it comes bundled with Altered Beast. Two beat em'up in the launch, Sega was way ahead.

Capcom, had the chance to make things even for Nintendo, but missed badly. Although the game was a almost perfect arcade conversion in terms of graphics, the lack of two player took away the replayability that NES's Double Dragon had. The sixteen bit's beat em' up title was took from Nintedo by Sega's `Streets of Rage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Rage>`_ later on. And here we go again, another game with Streets of Fire references. I think I see a pattern.

This year, we have the lauch of `Double Dragon 4`. Ok, before we go on. Let's pretend they never release either `Double Dragon Neon` game or the `Double Dragon` movie. It's perfect stated here Streets of Fire is the oficial Double Dragon movie and Willem Dafoe the leader of the Black Warrios gang.

The new adventure of the Lee brother's took place after the events of the DD3 and their sacred as hell stones, witch I would never be able to collect. Has all the main features from his predecessors. The 2 player co-op with friend fighing at the end from the first. The remarkable style with the arms over the body from the second. And, finally, the badguy's-join-the-party-after-you-beat-them.

It took decades for a fourh episode, and all the other beat'em up greaties never took this step (Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Final Fight each have 3 games). Why didn't they? My answer would be, the lack of style, good memories and nolstagia. That was not just the game that create and defines the beat'em up genre, it defines the "2 player" game style of the eighties.
