    Blender Bigger Brain*

On last week's post, I had a "to do" list over the comments of the "upcoming improvements". So `Toshimitsu Kamei <https://twitter.com/salexkidd>`_ came to the rescue again with the IO expander stuff. He sent some study material and sugests a small proof of concept just by following some internet tutorials. He sugests the use of a MCP23017 I2C port expander.

Then, let me share the links:

- `How To Use A MCP23017 I2C Port Expander With The Raspberry Pi - part 1 <http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2013/07/how-to-use-a-mcp23017-i2c-port-expander-with-the-raspberry-pi-part-1/>`_;
- `How To Use A MCP23017 I2C Port Expander With The Raspberry Pi - part 2 <http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2013/07/how-to-use-a-mcp23017-i2c-port-expander-with-the-raspberry-pi-part-2/>`_;
- `How To Use A MCP23017 I2C Port Expander With The Raspberry Pi - part 3 <http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2013/07/how-to-use-a-mcp23017-i2c-port-expander-with-the-raspberry-pi-part-3/>`_;
- `Working with I2C port expanders <http://hackaday.com/2011/06/07/working-with-i2c-port-expanders/>`_;

And then, let's start reading and connecting wire jumps over the protoboard. I don't think that I will achieve a major breaktru this week, but I do need to improve my hardware skills.
